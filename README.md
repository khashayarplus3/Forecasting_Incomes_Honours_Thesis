# Forecasting_Incomes_Honours_Thesis

**Description** 
Research project for Econ4905( econ honours thesis), built a model to forecast graduate's incomes from canadian post secondary institutions
Used the 2018 and 2013 version of the national graduates survey, used ETL to join the datasets and perform analysis 
Used variables such as the student's GPA, Age at graduation, Coop participation, reputation of school, student loan status, gender, Program studied(major), Field occupied in and certification level( college, BA ...) 
to predict their incomes using Regression analysis , Nonparametric models(KNN), hyperpaprameter testing, decision trees and other robust techniques 
used various data visualizations to efficiently interpret the results 

**Main results:**
GPA,higher years of schooling, coop participants, attending reputable institutions and age will
positively impact earnings of the graduates. Those with Higher levels of student loans and women tend to have lower earnings post graduation.  
Another significant factor was the program(major) that people studied had a large impact on incomes. This result was same 
with the field the individual is occupied in as there is a large deviation between the incomes 
between different occupational paths. The result also found that the year of graduation makes 
a difference in early career incomes as graduating during an economic downturn can hindurr the graduate's incomes for almost a decade. 
To see the quantitative impact of these variables, pls consult the research paper.
